# mpv-conf
this is pretty much just a repo for all of my mpv configurations so i can keep all of my installs updated,<br>
most of these scripts aren't made by me although i may have modified a lot of them, all sources have been added at the start of each script as a comment

## binds:
* **shift + m** | _mocks the audio and makes it sound stupid, made this because funny_
* **c** | _cycles between audio visaulizers (broken in windowed mode)_
* **ctrl + v** | _attempts to open the url from the clipboard_
* **alt + o** | _locates the current file_
* **f12** | _search for keybinds_
* **scroll wheel** | change volume
